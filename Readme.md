Compiling javacard applets with gradle
-------------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fidesmo/gradle-javacard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fidesmo/gradle-javacard)

This plugins allows for translation of compiled class files to the converted archive format. These files
can be used for installation on smart and sim cards supporting SUN/Oracle JavaCard Technology.

Features
--------

  - convert a package of class files into a cap file
  - specify multiple classes implementing Applet for later installation
  - add external EXP files to build
  - optional support for testing with [jcardsim](http://jcardsim.org)

Usage
-----

Include the new version of the plugin from OSS Sonatype snapshot by adding the following to your
`build.gradle`:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'javacard'

buildscript {

    repositories {
        maven { url 'http://releases.marmeladburk.fidesmo.com/' }
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.fidesmo:gradle-javacard:0.2.7'
    }
}

javacard {
    /* Specify which version of the JavaCard SDK should be used
       to build this project. Supported: 2.2.? and 3.0.? */
    sdkVersion = "3.0.4"

    cap {
        aid = '0x12:0x34:0x00:0x00:0x00:0x01'
        packageName = 'com.example.my.jc.code'
        applet {
            aid = '0x12:0x34:0x00:0x00:0x00:0x01:0x01'
            className = 'ClassImplementingApplet'
        }
        version = '1.0'
    }
}
```

### Installing the Java Card Development Kit

Before compiling you need to download the JavaCard SDK. The current implementation is tested using
Linux and the `Java Card Development Kit 2.2.2`. It is supposed to work also for all other `Java
Card Development Kit 2.x.x` under MacOSx, Windows and Linux. The development kit can be downloaded on the Oracle
[Website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/javacard/downloads/javacard-sdk-2043229.html)
and must be unpacked

```bash
# Assumes file to be downloaded as java_card_kit-2_2_2-linux.zip
unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-linux.zip
cd java_card_kit-2_2_2/
unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-bin-linux-do.zip
unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-ant-tasks.zip
export JC_HOME="${PWD}/java_card_kit-2_2_2"
```

### Convert applications to Java Card

The specified package is converted from jvm byte code to javaCard byte code, by running the
`convertJavaCard` task.

     # ensure JC_HOME is set correctly
     gradle convertJavacard

### Add exp files from vendors or other projects

To add external exp files to your build, add a dependencies section to your gradle.build and add the
corresponding paths to the javacardExport configuration. Usually you also will need to add some
classes in order to compile your java code to class files.

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile files('../path/to/class/files/dir')
    javacardExport files('../path/to/exp/files/dir')
}
```

### Support for testing with jcardsim

The java card plugin doesn't include a testing framework, but it contains several mechanisms to make
testing with jcardsim easier. To properly setup testing with jcardsim you have to add the central
maven repositories to your build.gradle and configure the testCompile configuration to include
jcardsim in the version you want.

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile 'com.licel:jcardsim:2.2.2'
}
```

If you follow the above the plugin will filter the runtime classpath of the test source set (usually
the classes you have under /src/test). The aim is to remove the lib/api.jar from the javacard sdk in
order to prevent clashes between the official javacard api and one provided by jcardsim.

### Building without javacard sdk

In case you want to run the build and the test one a continuous integration system, you can do so
without providing a javacard sdk. If no sdk is detected but jcardsim has been added the plugin
compiles you applet against the javacard api provided by jcardsim.

Converting the java code to java card applet is not supported without javacard sdk.
